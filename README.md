A portfolio of my projects as a Data Scientist/Data Analyst:

**Data_analysis_and_visualization_German_Cars_(RU)** -  project in data cleanup and visualization. The dataset contained data from the german used car market, my goal was to prepare the data, perform necessary visualizations and find patterns. I've also used this dataset as a sandbox to test out different theories on the car market in Germany. This notebook is in Russian.

**IoT_occupancy_detection** -  engineering project, the goal was to build a classifier to predict whether a room is occupied usind data from IoT (Internet of Things) sensors.

**housing_ml.ipynb** - entry to 'housing prices' competition on Kaggle.
